        // In JavaScript, arrays are a versatile and commonly used data structure. They come with a variety of built-in methods to manipulate and work with the data they contain. Here's an explanation of some of the most commonly used array methods:

// 1. toString(): This method converts an array into a comma-separated string of its elements and returns the resulting string. It does not modify the original array.


    let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
    let fruitsString = fruits.toString();
    console.log(fruitsString); // "apple,banana,cherry"


    // 2. pop(): The pop() method removes and returns the last element of an array, reducing the array's length by one.


    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let lastNumber = numbers.pop();
    console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
    console.log(lastNumber); // 5


    // 3. push(): The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.


    let colors = ['red', 'blue'];
    let newLength = colors.push('green', 'yellow');
    console.log(colors); // ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
    console.log(newLength); // 4


    // 4. join(): The join() method creates and returns a string by concatenating all the elements in an array. You can specify a separator to be used between the elements (default is a comma).


    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
    let fruitString = fruits.join(' and ');
    console.log(fruitString); // "apple and banana and cherry"


    // 5. shift(): The shift() method removes and returns the first element of an array, shifting all remaining elements one position to the left.

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let firstNumber = numbers.shift();
    console.log(numbers); // [2, 3, 4, 5]
    console.log(firstNumber); // 1

    // 6. unshift(): The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.


    colors = ['blue', 'green'];
    newLength = colors.unshift('red', 'yellow');
    console.log(colors); // ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green"]
    console.log(newLength); // 4


    // 7. length: This is not a method but a property of arrays. It returns the number of elements in the array. You can also set this property to change the length of the array, which can result in truncating or extending the array.


    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    console.log(numbers.length); // 5

    numbers.length = 3; // Truncates the array
    console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]

    numbers.length = 7; // Extends the array with empty slots
    console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, <4 empty items>]


    // 8. slice(): The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array as a new array. It accepts two optional parameters to specify the start and end index (end index is exclusive).


    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date'];
    let slicedFruits = fruits.slice(1, 3);
    console.log(slicedFruits); // ["banana", "cherry"]


    // 9. delete: The delete operator is used to remove an element from an array but does not update the array length. It leaves an empty slot in the array where the element used to be. It's not recommended for normal array manipulation.


    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    delete numbers[2];
    console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, empty, 4, 5]


    // 10. concat(): The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays into a new array, without modifying the original arrays.


    let arr1 = [1, 2];
    let arr2 = [3, 4];
    let combinedArray = arr1.concat(arr2);
    console.log(combinedArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4]


    // 11. splice(): The splice() method is a versatile method for adding, removing, or replacing elements in an array. It takes multiple parameters, including the index to start from, the number of elements to remove, and the elements to add.


    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    numbers.splice(2, 1); // Removes one element at index 2
    console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 4, 5]

    numbers.splice(2, 0, 6, 7); // Inserts 6 and 7 at index 2
    console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 6, 7, 4, 5]


    // These are some of the most commonly used array methods in JavaScript. They provide powerful tools for working with arrays and their elements.



    // No, the delete keyword cannot be used to delete an entire array in JavaScript. The delete operator is used to remove a specific element from an array, object, or other data structures, leaving an empty slot in the array or object. It does not change the array's length or completely remove the array itself.

    // To remove an entire array and free up the memory it occupies, you can simply assign null to the array or let it go out of scope. Here's an example of setting an array to null:

    let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    myArray = null; // This effectively removes the array and frees up memory
